THE "HELL DOOM-STYLE" LICENSE (Version 666)

Copyright (c) 2024 ovosimpatico

ABSOLUTELY NO PERMISSION IS GRANTED TO ANYONE, EVER, UNLESS YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING
RIDICULOUS CONDITIONS AS WITNESSED BY HELL AND THE LEGIONS OF DOOM:

1. You must defeat Hell in a 1v1 deathmatch using only the pistol.
2. You must have completed DOOM (1993) using only your feet.
3. Your keyboard must be covered in hot sauce at all times while coding.
4. You must scream "RIP AND TEAR" every time you commit code.
5. All debugging sessions must be conducted while wearing a Doomguy costume.
6. Your IDE theme must be "hellfire red" or "demon blood purple" - no exceptions.
7. You must sacrifice at least 3 rubber ducks to the Coding Gods before each pull request.
8. All variable names must contain at least one metal band reference.
9. Coffee must be consumed from a mug made from a Cacodemon skull.
10. Your Git commit messages must be written in the style of DOOM level names.

ADDITIONAL TERMS:
- If you encounter a bug, you must fight it in real life.
- Stack Overflow answers may only be read while heavy metal plays in the background.
- All error messages must be delivered by a text-to-speech demon voice.
- Code reviews must be conducted in a gladiatorial arena.
- The use of semicolons requires written permission from Hell herself.

WARRANTY INFORMATION:
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS CURSED", WITH ALL DEMONS INCLUDED. IF IT WORKS, THAT'S
SUSPICIOUS. IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. IF IT SUMMONS DEMONS, THAT'S A FEATURE.

LIABILITY:
THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
- Spontaneous demon spawns
- Portal to Hell appearances in your monitor
- Keyboard possession
- Mouse acceleration suddenly feeling like DOOM (1993)
- The urge to install DOS on modern hardware
- Uncontrollable headbanging while coding
- Sudden cravings for health potions

If any demons are spawned as a result of using this software, congratulations! You're now
their problem.

RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE (or until the code compiles, whichever comes first).

FINAL NOTE:
Any attempt to circumvent these conditions will result in immediate teleportation to the
final level of DOOM II with only a pistol. Good luck!
